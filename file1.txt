c. Objective 3:Determine the socioeconomic variables affecting the fair distribution and use of green areas for the sake of improving mental health.
3. Dataset:
Data collection from people of the city's many neighborhoods will be part of this study project. The dataset will contain demographic data, geographic information system (GIS) data on green areas, and mental health evaluations.
